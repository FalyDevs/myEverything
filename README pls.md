# myEverything
Every single thing that happen to me (programming related) since today! 19/02/2022

So, Here we go GitHub! first time working with this platform, basics about me!
 
 1. Who I am now-a-day.
        Spanish Engineer. I have been working since 2016 in some companies mainly developing hardware as electronic engineer, with a bit of experience in firmware develop, using           fpga and mcus. 
  
  2. Who I want to be.
        I'm changing my path into a BackEnd Developer. 10/01/2022. It was a cold night, I was working hard into one of my mulitple projects when I receive a letter from my wife.
        "Dear Rafael, You should be prepare for the new project I have just signed, it's called ABIC, which in english means "A Baby Is Coming", XOXO, Marina".
        I couldn't believe it! People still sends letter! so after a lot of thinking about how tradinional postmans didn't get new techs yet, I decided I have to update myself
        "I don't wanna be a postman, I want to be a BackEnd Developer!" (So I could work from home and take care of my baby!)
 
 3. What would I do to get there?
        This, my friend who is reading this readme.md, is yet to be seen. Hold my hand in this adventour and see the wonders the world has reserved for a single brain cell who           surrender his entire career to pursue the dream of a dreamer, becoming a BED person (BackEnd Developer it sounds so much better as BED Person)
 
 --------------------------------------------------MY MAIN BRANCH AND EVERYTHING YOU ARE GOING TO FIND HERE------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I would update this section everytime I commit new projects to my main branch. Some description about the projects include.
